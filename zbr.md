# How to Win at War Brokers Zombie Battle Royal by [Fish] Milan

## Mindset 

Zbr is a race that you are unlikely to win by sitting still. You must be working hard to loot and kill the entire match.

## Looting

In order to get enough ammo you will either need to completely empty a major location like space or training center, half of port city or del gato, or a couple minor locations. No matter where you start you will need to move to another one to stay on top of the killing.

Spliting loot with another player is not a good idea, so split up early and team later.

Early in the match find one weapon you absolutely need and put it in the number 2 slot and steal ammo from every weapon on the ground. If you are not holding the number 2 weapon, when you pick up something it goes to #1, and, if you pick up whatever is in #2 you will empty the ammo from that weapon. Try to keep the SMG in the #2 slot and pick up every AR, AK, hunting, sniper, 50, and SCAR until you have 200 rifle (green ammo). Use the #3, 4 or 5 slots to run around and loot because you move faster.

## Fun Fact

The Sub Machine Gun was modified for the zbr game mode to accept the 50 round magazine.

## Killing Zombies

Basically you want to aviod fighting more than 1 at a time in close. Your primary concern isnt killing, but not dying. Have one CQC (close quarters combat) weapon ready. I like to use the shotgun early to conserve ammo for smg and Ak/AR/SCAR later in the round. 

If you are far run towards the zombies, if you are close back up. If they are doing damage they will try to get under you, so strafe around them as you jimp and fire down.

## End Game

Healing while in the red zone is safer than getting swarmed by zombies. Wait until you are down to 200 health to heal with medium heath. While you are healing you can still fire your weapon, so stay back and the zombies will trickle towards you.
