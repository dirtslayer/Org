# Beat Addiction
notes from [12 Ways to Beat Addiction
By Therese J. Borchard](https://psychcentral.com/blog/12-ways-to-beat-addiction/)

## 1. Get Some Buddies
Use friends to remind you things will get better.

## 2. Read Away the Craving
Place reading material in places where you are likely to have a craving or need reminders. ie, print this and place it on your car dash.

## 3. Be Accountable to Someone
Have several people you can talk to about your success or failures. Accountability shows you that others care.

## 4. Predict Your Weak Spots
Certain activities will trigger cravings, keep a record of your triggers and formulate alternatives. ie, if gaming triggers your addiction have munchies ready as an alternative.

## 5. Distract Yourself
Use your guilty pleasures that do not involve your addiction. If you are having a craving do something that is easy and you enjoy.

## 6. Sweat
Usually exercise does not mix with well with addictions. Exercise is an antidepressant and will always improve your mindset.

## 7. Start a Project
Keeping busy will curb your cravings. Get that todo list tackled as well as fun projects.

## 8. Keep a Record
Addiction blinds you to self-destructive behavior and rationalizations. Use your credit card for substance purchases and track consumption.

## 9. Be the Expert
Helping someone else beat their addiction will help you with your own.

## 10. Grab Your Security Item
Having an object you value that reminds you of who you are will give you strength. IE your favorite knife, medal or figure.

## 11. Get on Your Knees
Pray for strength, even if you are atheist, be humble and acknowledge your helplessness over your addiction.

## 12. Do Nothing
At least your not getting worse, there is always tomorrow.
